It should be noted that in December, the price reduction was maintained for many groups of the consumer basket - including food and non-alcoholic beverages and medicines - which is an important benefit for broad sections of the society”, he said. The Deputy Minister said the reduction of inflation to the target level was made possible by the “purposeful” and “consistent” economic and monetary policy of the Government and the National Bank. In 2024, we expect inflation to remain close to the target of three percent. This will also be supported by the decision made by the Georgian National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission to reduce the electricity tariff, which will have a positive impact on the reduction of production costs and competitiveness of the private sector. Our expectation is that the price level will be stable during 2024”, the official said. The Commission last Thursday decided to reduce electricity tariffs for both household and non-household consumers by ₾0.03 per kWh starting this month. Prices of certain food products and non-alcoholic beverages increased month-on-month across Georgia in December, while prices for clothing and footwear and furnishings, household equipment and maintenance decreased, the National Statistics Office said on Wednesday.

The Patriarch stressed that “in the constant struggle between good and evil”, people would “constantly need more and more efforts to protect holiness”, noting “true faith has weakened” in recent centuries, a man “replaced the Creator”. Today, more than ever, there is a real danger that human self-centeredness will threaten the purpose for which we were born, because the world is developing technologically, but our spiritual progress is lagging behind it, and we are facing many psychological and bioethical challenges”, his Holiness said in his epistle. The Christmas epistle also referred to the “potential” of artificial intelligence, created by “collective knowledge of mankind”, to make “a huge change” in people’s lives, but emphasised that “without human spiritual development”, the “negative consequences” had to be also considered. God is “above logical categories” and the human mind can not reach him even with the “collective knowledge of mankind”, the Patriarch said, noting to strive for personal perfection, “one should desire to know God with the cognition of his truth”.

Photo: Nino Alavidze/Agenda.ge The National Bank of Georgia on Monday published an analysis of the current situation and macroeconomic parameters in the country's banking and financial sectors, reviewing inflation, deposits and loans with dollarisation share in the portfolio and foreign sector. The NBG said annual inflation in December amounted to 0.4 percent, and prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to November. It said the low inflation was caused by the downward trend of local inflation, which was the result of a “strict” monetary policy. Real effective exchange rate of the Georgian national currency, the lari, maintains a strong position. This, together with the gradual reduction of external shocks, helps to keep the imported inflation at a low level. Inflation of locally produced products decreased to 3.6 percent in December”, the Bank said. The NBG explained the decrease in the imports was mainly caused by the decrease in the import of intermediate goods, while the decrease in the exports was largely caused by the decrease in the export of intermediate goods. Prices of certain food products and non-alcoholic beverages increased month-on-month across Georgia in December, while prices for clothing and footwear and furnishings, household equipment and maintenance decreased, the National Statistics Office said on Wednesday.

The Minister was speaking after the companies were fined ₾53 million ($19.71mln) for conspiring to keep artificially inflated prices on oncology medicines funded within the state programme - a decision they could appeal in court. He noted “special bases” had been created for the purpose of monitoring the ongoing prices of the drugs. [T]he fact is quite clear [of] concerted actions of these companies against our country to pay much more money from the budget based on artificially increased prices”, he said. Azarashvili added the violations meant consumers had been “left without medicines”, as the “three and four times” increased prices had resulted in ""premature expenditure” of limited state funds designated for the medicines. He said he hoped the “strict response” from the authorities would mean violations of the kind would not be repeated, and added provision of oncological medicines had begun to be “gradually taken over” by the state from this year.

Sarjveladze’s comments followed the call voiced by Beka Liluashvili, a member of the party founded by the former Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, who on Monday said the future President of the country should be directly elected. The term of the current President Salome Zourabichvili ends in October, with an electoral college set to elect her successor.

In this system, the model of electing the President that is defined by the current constitution is reasonable. By the way, Giorgi Gakharia, who represented the Georgian Dream party [in the past], had the same position [at the time]. It is not clear why his position has changed”, Sarjveladze said. “When we are talking about the constitutional order, the constitution cannot be tailored to some political process.

Gotsiridze added Georgia's exports to the countries of Central Asia had increased, facilitating entry of such goods into Russia. In response to the allegations, Volski said ""I cannot imagine the opposition is pleased with the absence of black holes in Georgia. They have built their [anti-Government] strategy around the existence of these black holes"". He further noted the country's authorities relied on international assessments rather than reports from platforms like factcheck.ge, which was launched in 2013 by the domestic Georgian Reforms Associates non-governmental organisation. He cited sanctions officials from the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, who visited Georgia in June, in their commending the Georgian authorities for preventing entry of sanctioned goods into Russia. Irakli Kadagishvili, a fellow GD MP,  added Georgia was “actively engaged in continuous collaboration” with the US, EU and the UK to prevent the inflow of sanctioned goods to Russia, emphasising “from this standpoint, Georgia is steadfast in fulfilling its international obligations”. He asserted the domestic opposition was “worried” the country had built a “commendable reputation worldwide” in contrast to some of the countries imposing the sanctions. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Monday said domestic authorities had prevented “1,000 cases” of attempts of evasion of the international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, with “not a single fact” of their successful circumvention identified in the country. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Friday highlighted this week’s visit of sanctions officials from the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States to the country by saying the domestic public had heard their assessments of “effective control” by the Government in not allowing circumvention of the sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions officials from the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, who were on a visit to Georgia this week, on Wednesday highlighted they had been “convinced” that the country’s Government was “seriously” determined not to allow the circumvention of sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. James O'Brien, the Head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination in the United States, on Wednesday said the Georgian Government had done “a great job” in preventing the circumvention of sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. David Matikashvili, an MP for the ruling Georgian Dream party, on Wednesday said the opposition United National Movement party and “its various branches” were “trying to correct their positions through a PR campaign”, an outcome he said was “not possible”. Irakli Kobakhidze, the head of the ruling Georgian Dream party, on Wednesday said citizens of the country “must make a choice not in favour of the war party” - in reference to the opposition United National Movement - but for “peace, tranquillity and economic development”. copyright

Photo: Salome Tsereteli/Agenda.ge The Georgian economy is projected to grow 4.8 percent in 2024 in the January edition of the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report, published on Wednesday. The report said growth was expected to ease this year, reflecting a projected slowdown among trading partners of Georgia as well as further reduction in money transfer inflows. Monetary policy is expected to be eased to support economic growth while remaining prudent”, it said. The report also notes the Georgian economy grew 6.5 percent in 2023. This is higher than originally forecasted, as a rebound in private consumption coupled with continued recovery in tourism helped offset a decline in money transfer inflows”, it points out. The release also said inflation was expected to be below the three percent target rate at the end of this year after having declined “sharply” in 2023, driven by lower commodity prices - particularly for food and fuel - along with a “strong” Georgian national currency, the lari. The National Bank of Georgia on Monday published an analysis of the current situation and macroeconomic parameters in the country's banking and financial sectors, reviewing inflation, deposits and loans with dollarisation share in the portfolio and foreign sector. The Georgian economy grew 5.9 percent year-over-year in November, while the average real GDP growth between January and November equalled 6.9 percent, the National Statistics Office of Georgia said on Friday. Irakli Kobakhidze, the head of the ruling Georgian Dream party, on Thursday said the domestic gross domestic product per capita would exceed $12,000 by 2028 according to the forecast by the International Monetary Fund, with the development meaning that “poverty will almost disappear” across the country. Georgian Economy Minister Levan Davitashvili on Monday said the country maintained an “advanced position” in the wider region for its economic growth rate, and credited the outcome with the Government’s “prudent” macroeconomic policy. Fitch Ratings, a global credit rating agency, has affirmed Georgia’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating status at ‘BB’ rating, also maintaining the assessment of the financial outlook for the country’s financial developments as “positive”.

Kaladze said former fines for the violation had been “insufficient for certain builders”, a circumstance he claimed had damaged the city’s “appearance and rights of every resident”. The amendments, which will come into play starting on Thursday, involve handing out ₾250,000 ($93,117) in fines for illegal construction on state- or municipally-owned real estate within cultural heritage protection zones.

Preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections in Georgia and introduction of an electronic voting system ahead of the vote were discussed in a meeting between a delegation of the Central Election Commission of Georgia and representatives of the United States Agency for International Development and International Republican Institute in Washington on Tuesday. Shalva Papuashvili, the Georgian Parliament Speaker, on Monday said the introduction of electronic voting across the country ahead of the 2024 Parliamentary Elections would “remove all kinds of speculation” by domestic “radical groups” about “rigged elections”. The new constitution of Georgia, which was adopted in 2017, has automatically come into play after the yesterday’s presidential inauguration. Beka Davituliani, an MP from the ruling Georgian Dream party, on Thursday slammed the United National Movement party for “creating a storm in a teacup” after the latter called for the country’s Foreign Ministry to formally request observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe for the parliamentary elections in the country later this year.

The joint statement stressed that the transfer of these weapons was increasing the suffering of the Ukrainian people, was supporting Russia’s war of aggression, and was undermining the global non-proliferation regime.

"  The Patriarchate stated its intention to undertake ""necessary modifications” if the donors would not implement them. Photo: Patriarchate press office  The Patriarchate of the Georgian Orthodox Christian Church on Thursday asked donors of an icon seen at Tbilisi’s Holy Trinity Cathedral to modify its visuals showing St. Matrona of Moscow, a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church, alongside Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, after a photograph of the icon sparked controversy on social media and led to its defacement. The icon was donated by the Alliance of Patriots domestic opposition group and its leader Irma Inashvili, who have been accused of ties with Russia on the backdrop of the country’s occupation of Georgian territories, with the depiction of the Soviet ruler also leading to controversy. The debate on social media was sparked after cleric Ilia Chigladze published the image of the icon on his social media account on January 6, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral priest saying the icon had been placed there three months ago. Police are also looking into an incident on Tuesday in which the icon was defaced with paint by an alleged civic activist, with the ruling Georgian Dream party announcing amendments to tighten the law for acts of “insulting religious objects”. In its comments, the Patriarchate said Stalin’s presence on the icon had triggered “unresolved, contentious discussions and confrontations, further exacerbated by political undertones” and added the icon had become the target of “unjustified offensive actions” and escalating tensions. In comments on the content of the visuals of the icon, the body said the alleged meeting between Stalin and the saint was “not supported by sufficient evidence”, was not included in the canonical text of the latter’s life, and was not recognised by the Russian Church which canonised her. It further noted a dedicated study on the matter had been conducted and led to the conclusion that it was “imperative” to revise the visuals, also stating its intention to undertake ""necessary modifications” if the donors would not implement them. The religious organisation further explained canonical rules of iconography allowed depiction of not only saints but also non-religious individuals - including “rulers, ordinary people, torturers and persecutors” of Christian figures and faith - without glorifying them. The world has always been contradictory, but today's conflicts and wars pose “a real danger of turning into a global catastrophe and destroying all of humanity”. That is why we should all care for peace, the Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia Ilia II said in his annual Christmas epistle ahead of Christmas mass last night. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Monday hailed the “exemplary leadership” of Patriarch Ilia II of the domestic Orthodox Christian Church on the 46th anniversary of his enthronement, personally conveying his “warmest wishes” to the religious leader at the Patriarchate in Tbilisi while accompanied by his family. Ilia II, the Catholicos Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, on Friday hailed the efforts of the current Government and Georgian people in obtaining the European Union membership candidate status. Ilia II, the Catholicos Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church and religious leaders from the Church on Wednesday met foreign diplomats to discuss the anticipated granting of the European Union membership candidate status to the country. Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Tuesday slammed an alleged “coordinated campaign” by the “radical wing” of the domestic opposition against the Christian Orthodox Church of the country, which he claimed was aimed at “demeaning” the “symbols and values around which Georgians have rallied historically”. Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Saturday urged all international donors in the country to “proactively ensure” that their funds align with shared values in human rights and to avoid support for projects and individuals fostering societal radicalisation amid the absence of legislation on foreign funding transparency. The Tbilisi City Court on Friday sentenced civil activist Nata Peradze to five-day administrative detention for pouring paint on an icon showing Saint Matrona of Moscow and Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Tbilisi earlier last month. copyright

He further noted “[a]ll observer missions are expected to monitor the elections, which are expected to be conducted efficiently and surpass previous standards”. Davituliani stressed the introduction of electronic voting for the race, which will be held through fully proportional elections for the first time in the country, would “significantly reduce” risk of vote-rigging. He also claimed the observers would “recognise the outcome [of the voting] that will be positive” for the ruling power. Georgia’s Central Election Commission on Wednesday set October 26 as the date for this year’s parliamentary elections and outlined mandatory registration procedures for participating parties.

Shalva Papuashvili, the Georgian Parliament Speaker, on Monday said the introduction of electronic voting across the country ahead of the 2024 Parliamentary Elections would “remove all kinds of speculation” by domestic “radical groups” about “rigged elections”.

"  Speaker Papuashvili was commenting following the 2024 World Report by Human Rights Watch. Photo: Shalva Papuashvili’s Facebook Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Friday slammed “politically biased” and “speculative” assessments by the “elite” domestic non-governmental sector, which he claimed were subsequently “inserted” into reports of foreign organisations with political aims. Papuashvili was commenting following the 2024 World Report by Human Rights Watch, published this week, which made a mention of the controversial Foreign Transparency Bill, retracted by the Georgian Parliament in March 2023 after mass protests in Tbilisi. The Report also critically noted changes in accreditation rules for media in the domestic legislative body, with the Speaker claiming the document had been based on evaluations by domestic NGOs. With regard to the former issue, the Report said the Georgian authorities had attempted to adopt the piece of legislation that “would have undermined freedom of expression” by designating non-commercial legal entities and media outlets in the country as “agents of foreign influence” if they derived more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad. It also pointed to “lack of accountability for law enforcement abuses, especially related to freedom of assembly”. On the latter topic, the release said in February 2023 the Parliament had passed new, “restrictive regulations” on media accreditation, which allowed the authorities to ban journalists from asking MPs questions after they refused to be interviewed. It noted officials had cited alleged harassment of lawmakers by journalists to justify the amendments, which it said could hamper the work of critical media. In his response, Papuashvili claimed the allegations by “elite NGOs” about law enforcement exceeding their powers in actions against public rallies held since 2019 in capital Tbilisi had been “rejected” by judgements of the European Court of Human Rights. It is evident that visions and perceptions of elite NGOs that receive the biggest portion of foreign funding are a part of their political struggle and the method with which international conclusions are weaponised”, Papuashvili said, adding the ECHR had rejected the organisations’ claims over domestic law enforcement in “various cases” and concluded the police had acted in accordance with the law. Speaking about the Foreign Transparency Bill, Papuashvili said the law was “now widely accepted as necessary” due to “covert” foreign funding of domestic organisations.

He also claimed the organisation “encourages extremism and radicalism” by “covering [court] expenses of those who have assaulted police and the Parliament building [in Tbilisi during protests]”. With regard to a question on regulations for issuing accreditations for the media in the lawmaking body, Papuashvili said the country’s Constitutional Court was examining the matter, and added the review would rule whether reporters “chasing after lawmakers or visitors in the halls of the Parliament” following their refusals of comments would be ruled as acceptable.

"  Georgia’s “solid” economic growth prospects were also highlighted in the report, noting that the arrival of migrants had a “positive spillover” on economic activity and estimating economic growth of 5 percent in 2024 and 5.1 percent in 2025. Photo: Nino Alavidze/Agenda.ge Fitch Ratings, a global credit rating agency, has affirmed Georgia’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating status at ‘BB’ rating, also maintaining the assessment of the financial outlook for the country’s financial developments as “positive”. The international agency noted the rating was supported by Georgia’s “strong governance” and economic development indicators relative to the 'BB' medians, including “credible macroeconomic and fiscal policy framework”, “moderate level” of public debt and “sound banking sector”. The Positive Outlook reflects continued strong economic growth, alongside a marked fall in inflation, and greater confidence in the durability of large migrant and capital inflows since 2022 that have boosted potential growth and the external position”, the latest report said. Georgia’s “solid” economic growth prospects were also highlighted in the report, noting that the arrival of migrants had a “positive spillover” on economic activity and estimating economic growth of 5 percent in 2024 and 5.1 percent in 2025. Fitch expects the budget deficit to decline from an estimated 2.5 percent of GDP in 2023 to 2.4 percent in 2024 and 2.3 percent in 2025. The report also said the fall in inflation to 0.4 percent at the end of 2023 was “driven by strong base effects and a robust lari”. The Government debt is expected to remain around 38 percent of GDP in 2024-2025, the agency emphasised, noting lari depreciation “poses the greatest risk to debt dynamics”, however, the risk “is mitigated” by a majority of “external debt” sourced from bilateral and multilateral donors. Obtaining the European Union membership candidate status by Georgia in December 2023 was also highlighted in the report, which said “the geopolitical risks with Russia remain high”, in the context of “international scrutiny with regard to sanctions enforcement”, and Georgia's aspirations to join NATO and the EU. Additionally, the report touched on the “governance risks”, citing changes to the central bank law and political tensions in the country. The ruling Georgian Dream party is “anticipated to maintain its economic policy stance by the October 2024 parliamentary elections”, it added. The suspension of Georgia's IMF Stand-By Agreement in September 2023, “amid concerns over institutional independence raised by the central bank law”, was also mentioned by Fitch, saying the changes to the central bank law “undermine the independence of the central bank and complicates the sanctions enforcement regime for banks”. Fitch Ratings, a global financial ratings firm, in its update on Friday, has affirmed Georgia’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating status at a BB level, revising the financial outlook for the country’s financial developments from “stable” to “positive”.

"  Inflation is expected to remain below the target of three percent at the beginning of 2024, while stabilising close to the target in the medium term, the NBG said. Photo: Nino Alavidze/Agenda.ge The National Bank of Georgia on Wednesday said it was continuing its exit from a tight monetary policy by reducing the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points, down to nine percent, due to “low inflation environment”. Natia Turnava, the Acting Governor of the National Bank, said the body had started reducing the strict monetary policy in May of last year. Since then the monetary policy has been reduced by two percent, although we still have one of the highest rates in the wider region”, Turnava said. She added the policy had hit its peak at 11 percent last year, before the Bank “gradually” started to exit it after observing a downward trajectory for inflation. Turnava said in comments on the subject the central Bank should be “the most cautious public institution in the country”. Inflation is expected to remain below the target of three percent at the beginning of 2024, while stabilising close to the target in the medium term, the Bank said. The latest inflation data by the National Statistics Office of Georgia showed the consumer price index increased by 0.1 percent in December compared to the previous month, while the annual inflation rate amounted to 0.4 percent. The central bank noted the “low” inflation was a result of both domestic and external factors, including the tight monetary policy and lower inflation expectations that it said had led inflation of domestically produced goods on a downward trajectory. It added price pressures stemming from external shocks - the Russia-Ukraine war and the Covid-19 pandemic - had “significantly diminished”, contributing to a lower overall inflation rate. The Bank also mentioned domestic economic activity in the past year had made an impact on the inflation rate as well. It projected economic activity in 2024 would “gradually normalise” in line with the growth rate of potential gross domestic product, estimated at five percent. The body noted the granting of the European Union membership candidate status for Georgia in December had “visibly reduced” the sovereign risk premium, which, with all else being equal, could result in a lower neutral policy rate. However, the Bank also indicated inflationary risks caused by the ongoing “acute geopolitical environment” that was creating uncertainty in shipping costs. The National Bank said it “remained vigilant” in monitoring economic trends and financial markets, and would implement “all available instruments” to “ensure stability of prices”. The Georgian economy grew 8.3 percent year-on-year in December and by seven percent in 2023, the National Statistics Office said on Wednesday.

"  Kakha Bekauri, the Chair of the ComCom, rejected a statement by MagtiCom, which called for an Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation of his work, as “absurd accusations”. Photo: ComCom Kakha Bekauri, the Chair of the Georgian National Communications Commission, on Wednesday rejected a statement by the domestic internet and mobile telecommunications operator MagtiCom, which on Tuesday called for an Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation of his work, as “absurd accusations”. Bekauri’s comments were following the company’s raising of questions about his shareholding in a local supermarket chain and in the Skhva Arkhi company, as well as the participation of his spouse in a masterclass project of the Media Academy of the Commission. The Chair said his shares in the store chain was “in full compliance with law” and added the Skhva Arkhi company was “not a legal entity within the scope of the Commission's regulation”. On allegations regarding his spouse's participation in the masterclass, Bekauri said she had “shared her many years of journalistic knowledge and experience with budding and active journalists without any compensation” in the event. The Commission Chair added  “any interested individual” could “easily verify” the facts around the involvement in his wife's public asset declaration, where he said “no income” from the Academy was registered to her. The feeble attempts of Magticom to shift the focus from the main problems to fictional topics are directly related to the activities and decisions of the Communications Commission, which is aimed at improving competition in the telecom market. In this way, MagtiCom is trying to blatantly interfere and influence the activities of the Commission”, Bekauri said in his rejection of the company's calls. He added a “possible motive” for MagtiCom’s “open confrontation” was steps taken by the Commission to “open up the market”, including its study of prices for mobile and fixed services, the results of which were “alarming and noteworthy”. The study released earlier this month said the service for providing fixed internet at speeds of 100 Mbps was 136 percent more expensive in Georgia compared to European states, while costs for mobile internet packages with 10 GB of data and 1795 minutes of talk time were 35 percent higher in the country. The results of the research conducted by European experts show a grim picture in the [domestic] telecom market. These results are known to MagtiCom, they also know the Commission will make effective and effective decisions in accordance with the European legislation in order to improve the Georgian telecom market and provide consumers with the appropriate quality and price after completing the research”, Bekauri said. He added while the public had “not yet seen the complete results” of the research, MagtiCom was “well-aware” of the “documents and recommendations” prepared by European experts, who he said were recommending additional regulations on the company in order to improve the market. The official claimed the company was “aware of the possible decisions” of the Commission that could lead to “new requirements” being imposed on the business entity. He said the threat meant the company was “trying to blatantly interfere” in the activities of the Commission and “influence its decisions” - an alleged attempt he called “weak” and added the “absurd accusations” would “fail to affect the Commission's activities”. MagtiCom later released a statement in response to Bekauri’s comments, in which the company said the Commission Chair had “attempted to influence the objective study of the [alleged corruption] issue by the Bureau by his own assessments” before the investigation was over. The company said Bekauri’s labelling of the allegations as “absurd” before the Bureau’s investigation into them meant “simply [voicing] his wish and not the reality”, and added it would also “inform the public about other activities” of the body's Chair. The Georgian National Communications Commission on Wednesday said the service for providing fixed internet at speeds of 100 Mbps was 136 percent more expensive in Georgia compared to European states, while costs for mobile internet packages with 10 GB of data and 1795 minutes of talk time were 35 percent higher in the country.

"  Papuashvili claimed the ruling party “does embrace the values” of the Church but the Government “is strictly separated from it”. Photo: Shalva Papuashvili Facebook  Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Tuesday slammed an alleged “coordinated campaign” by the “radical wing” of the domestic opposition against the Christian Orthodox Church of the country, which he claimed was aimed at “demeaning” the “symbols and values around which Georgians have rallied historically”. The official, whose comment came following a controversy around the image featuring Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on an icon of Russian Saint Matrona, donated to the Tbilisi Holy Trinity Cathedral by members of a political party, and around the date Georgia celebrates Christmas, also stressed the “real purpose” of the “slanderous campaign” was to “damage the Church, the Government, and, with them, undermine our joint historic endeavour”. This hostile rhetoric also implies that national and religious values cannot co-exist with Western, European values. However, the truth is that the two are mutually fulfilling, and even reinforcing”, he stressed. In details over the icon donated by the Alliance of Patriots domestic opposition group to the Cathedral, Papuashvili noted Giorgi Kandelaki, a former official under the United National Movement Government, had published a video on his social media account on the Christmas eve, alleging he had found an “icon of Stalin” in the church. Georgia’s radical opposition has recently undertaken yet another attack against the incumbent Georgian Dream, through vilifying the Georgian Orthodox Church, accusing us of mythical ‘pro-Russian’ stand. While this futile ‘Russian’ argument is getting so exhausted that even our… pic.twitter.com/nCJky8rE4m Papuashvili highlighted the icon featured a “small insert into the icon of St Matrona, depicting the latter’s supposed conversation with Stalin during World War II”, with the Orthodox Church deciding earlier this month to change this particular detail “not because the depiction of a tyrant was uncanonical, but because the fact of the above mentioned conversation was, most likely, untrue”. He claimed a parallel line of an alleged attack on the Church aimed at compromising the date of celebrating Christmas on January 7 - instead of December 25 - and calling the celebrations “the Russian Christmas”. However, the reality is that celebrating Christmas by the Julian calendar is an inherently Georgian tradition, having nothing to do with either Russia or the Russian Church”, Papuashvili added. He alleged the controversies had been taken up by the “radicals” to also “viciously attack” Ilia II, the Catholicos-Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, whom he labelled as the country's “most venerated and authoritative public figure by general acclaim and according to any public opinion poll”. In their hostile campaign, the opposition and their affiliated talking heads linked the Patriarch, the Church, and the Government with Russia”, Papuashvili noted, rejecting them as “absurd”, “pointless” and “counter-productive”. Describing the Georgian Church as “one of the oldest in the world” and an institution he said had “heroically resisted the overwhelming and violent onslaught by the Bolshevik and then Communist totalitarianism”, Papuashvili called it the “only national institution that refuses to get involved in political polarisation” and “always listens to people”. He claimed the ruling party “does embrace the values” of the Church but the Government “is strictly separated from it”. The Patriarchate of the Georgian Orthodox Christian Church on Thursday asked donors of an icon seen at Tbilisi’s Holy Trinity Cathedral to modify its visuals showing St. Matrona of Moscow, a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church, alongside Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, after a photograph of the icon sparked controversy on social media and led to its defacement. Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Sunday claimed the country’s citizens had “rejected” the opposition United National Movement party, President Salome Zourabichvili - who he said was “now [playing] to their tune” - and other political groups, adding the European Union had done the same with its decision to grant the country the bloc’s membership candidate status earlier this month. Shalva Papuashvili, the Georgian Parliament Speaker, on Monday claimed a part of domestic opposition groups and affiliated non-governmental organisations were engaged in “instigating xenophobia on ethnic grounds” amid the presence of Russian citizens in the country on the backdrop of Moscow’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Monday said the 2024 Parliamentary Elections in the country would be an “object of observation”, and highlighted the importance of ensuring “a lot of engagement” to counter a “huge flood of disinformation”. Georgia's progress in implementing the European Union recommendations for the membership candidate status was discussed on Thursday in a meeting between the Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili and Bjørn Berge, the Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe. Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Saturday urged all international donors in the country to “proactively ensure” that their funds align with shared values in human rights and to avoid support for projects and individuals fostering societal radicalisation amid the absence of legislation on foreign funding transparency.

"  Beka Dzamashvili, the Deputy Justice Minister of Georgia, called the report “very important”. Photo: Justice Ministry press office Beka Dzamashvili, the Deputy Justice Minister of Georgia, on Thursday said the latest report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment had observed “no cases of violence and mistreatment” of prisoners, including Georgia’s former President Mikheil Saakashvili, in the civilian clinic in Tbilisi where the former official has been undergoing treatment since 2022. Commenting on the report, published earlier during the day following the visit of the Committee’s delegation to the country in March 2023, the official cited the report as saying the majority of convicts receiving treatment in the Vivamedi clinic were “satisfied” by its service and the staff. The [visiting] professionals acknowledged the clinic has provided all conditions to ensure adequate medical services to prisoners. This concerns both the infrastructure and the medical staff and the provided medical services”, Dzamashvili said, calling the report “very important” considering his office’s stance to “protect the rights of inmates and offer adequate medical services” to them. The report, which was published by the request of the Georgian Government, said the Committee delegation had enjoyed “very good cooperation” overall from the management and staff of the clinic, especially in being provided access to the premises and ability to speak with patients in private. It stressed the delegation heard “no allegations of ill-treatment of patients by staff” working on the three secure wards of the clinic, and the atmosphere appeared to be “relaxed”, with several patients speaking “positively of both the healthcare and custodial staff”. The document also highlighted material conditions in the secure part of the clinic were “on the whole adequate, as could indeed be expected from a healthcare facility”. It added ventilation and artificial lighting “were good as well” and patients had “unrestricted access” to good-quality toilets, washing and shower facilities. The report, however, pointed to the clinic’s failure to offer a proper therapeutic environment and ensure quality medical records, indicated restrictions on movement within the venue's floors and presence of permanent surveillance, along with a lack of outdoor exercises for inmates.The report recommended the introduction of management by the clinic’s medical staff over the secure wards. It also said in the situation of Saakashvili, although his access “to a range of medical specialists and treatments”, the “combination of factors such as being held alone for many months, being deprived of outdoor exercise and being subjected to permanent CCTV monitoring results in a situation that is oppressive, degrading and not conducive to improving his health condition”. Ex-President Saakashvili, who currently holds Ukrainian citizenship and was arrested in 2021 in Tbilisi, is serving his six-year term for abuse of power while in office in two separate cases, and is legally banned from participation in Georgian politics as a foreign citizen. Video grab. In its reply, the Georgian Justice Ministry stressed Saakashvili had “repeatedly declined” consultations with a psychologist and a psychiatrist and ""consistently refused” to avail himself of the right to outdoor activity. The body also said certain recommendations had been addressed, including the provision of tables and chairs in wards, installation of telephones for inmates and development of infrastructure for outdoor activities for clinic inmates. It also downplayed other issues such as concerns over the video surveillance protocol of the former official, quality of medical records, transfer of prison healthcare responsibilities to another state agency and the clinic’s security arrangements. Reacting to the report, the United National Movement, the largest opposition faction in the country founded by Saakashvili, claimed the document had “confirmed” the former official was “unable” to receive “proper treatment” in the clinic, where he was transferred in May 2022, and was a “victim of degrading treatment”. The party further asserted the “political imprisonment” of Saakashvili, who currently holds Ukrainian citizenship and was arrested on his clandestine return to Georgia in October 2021, “destroys the opportunity for the Georgian people to express their will in a free, fair and competitive environment” in this year’s parliamentary elections. On his part, Irakli Kadagishvili, an MP from the ruling Georgian Dream party, claimed the report had highlighted “tangible progress in terms of the current situation in the penitentiary system” and movement “in the right direction on the path of reforms”, noting “if something needs to be improved, it will be addressed”. He further stressed “even Sweden and Norway may not meet all the recommendations” issued by related bodies, and claimed Saakashvili’s family could “ease” his “alleged loneliness” through “frequent visits”. Shalva Papuashvili, the Georgian Parliament Speaker, on Monday alleged a group of members of the European Parliament was taking “deliberate actions to harm Georgia’s image” in a bid to facilitate an “illegal release” of the imprisoned former President Mikheil Saakashvili from detention. The European Court of Human Rights ruling in a case involving a former prisoner has “confirmed” torture and inhuman treatment were “systematic and widespread” in Georgian prisons under the United National Movement Government, the country’s Justice Ministry said on Friday. Georgia’s imprisoned former President Mikheil Saakashvili has been transferred from the No. 12 Prison in the city of Rustavi to the civilian clinic Vivamedi in capital Tbilisi, following an offer for the transfer from the Justice Ministry, made after demands on the matter from Saakashvili’s medical team and members of a part of political opposition. Georgia’s former President Mikheil Saakashvili has been detained today, Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili has announced. ""Our law enforcement agencies had prior information about his (Saakashvili’s) movement from Ukraine to Georgia and the process was under the control” Garibashvili stated. Rati Bregadze, the Georgian Justice Minister, on Monday said the latest report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment had reflected the cooperation offered to the body by the Tbilisi clinic where the imprisoned former President Mikheil Saakashvili is undergoing treatment. Mikheil Sarjveladze, the Chair of the Parliament's Human Rights Committee, on Thursday denounced an amendment introduced by Anna Fotyga, a member of the European Parliament, to a resolution to urge the Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili to pardon the imprisoned former President Mikheil Saakashvili, as “provocative”. copyright

The Speaker claimed Georgia stood “as an oasis of peace” amid expected “challenging geopolitical conditions” due to upcoming elections in several countries, the conflict in Ukraine, “the situation in Israel and between Iran and Pakistan”. He said the peaceful condition in Georgia “needs to be sustained”, adding the objective required “particular concentration and unity this year” among the domestic public. The representatives of the ruling Georgian Dream party on Saturday highlighted the importance of the return of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the former Prime Minister and founder of the GD party, to politics, who earlier today was elected the honorary Chair of the party. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the newly elected honorary Chair of the ruling Georgian Dream party, the former Prime Minister and the founder of the GD party, on Saturday said despite “being de-facto sanctioned” in the “harshest ways” and by “bypassing all the laws”, he was doing “very well” and was returning to politics to further help Georgia. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Saturday said the “main goal, mission and dream” of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the former PM and founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party, before and after coming into politics, were the unification of the country. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the former Prime Minister and founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party, on Saturday was elected the honorary Chair of the GD party at the congress meeting of the ruling party. Mikheil Sarjveladze, the Chair of the Georgian Parliament's Committee on Human Rights, on Saturday said the return of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party and the former Prime Minister, to politics in December as the party’s Honorary Chair was creating “a huge potential” for the success of the GD party. Irakli Kobakhidze, the head of the ruling Georgian Dream party, on Wednesday said the “direct” involvement of Bidzina Ivanishvili - the former Prime Minister and founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party - in politics could bring “positive processes” to the country “in many ways”. copyright

Photo via Parliament of Georgia Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Saturday told the media that those who were “fueling” anti-Chinese sentiments in Georgia were attempting to undermine “strategically important projects” and turn Georgia into a “dead end” instead of “a corridor”, connecting Asia to Europe. It is in the interest of our country [Georgia] to use the Middle Corridor [a logistics route connecting Central Asia and China to Europe], [and] facilitate the transit of goods between Europe and China through the country”, the Parliament Speaker pointed out. In his comments, Papuashvili slammed representatives of domestic opposition for their “criticism” over the week-long visit of the ruling Georgian Dream party’s delegation to China, which came following the signing of a strategic deal between the states last year, by saying “the opposition disregards national interests [of Georgia]”.

The officials also reviewed the results of justice and penitentiary system reforms, with Bregadze stressing that the systemic problem of inhuman treatment and torture was completely eliminated in Georgian prisons, which was confirmed by “a number of international authoritative organisations”, including the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Photo via Justice Ministry Since 2012, the ECHR has not received any lawsuits against Georgia from prisoners, the Minister added.

In a press conference following a controversy around the image featuring Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on an icon of Russian Saint Matrona, donated to the Tbilisi Holy Trinity Cathedral by members of a political party and around the date Georgia celebrates Christmas, Papuashvili said the radical opposition was involved in “the coordinated assault” on the Orthodox Church by civil activists and media. For the first time in the history of independent Georgia, we witnessed the desecration of an icon in the church. The first time, after the collapse of the Soviet empire, the Orthodox congregation became an object of harassment because of the celebration of Christmas”, Papuashvili noted. He condemned the participation of Beka Mindiashvili, the Head of the Tolerance Centre, which allegedly operates under the Public Defender, in “orchestrating a campaign attacking on religious grounds instead of promoting religious tolerance”. Papuashvili said the Public Defender Levan Ioseliani had revealed that the Tolerance Centre was not a structural unit of his office. The Parliament Speaker criticised the misappropriation of the name of the constitutional body - Public Defender by the Centre and added that it “misleads the citizens and presents the non-governmental organisation as a state institution”. He further explained that the Tolerance Centre was a separate project funded by the United States Agency for International Development, and called on the USAID to “clarify the matter and act in the best interest of both American and Georgian people”. The Parliament Speaker also expressed concern over the fact that Giorgi Kandelaki, the representative of the NGO Soviet Past Research Laboratory and a member of the opposition European Georgia party, was “igniting hysteria” related to the icon in the Trinity Cathedral. The Patriarchate of the Georgian Orthodox Christian Church on Thursday asked donors of an icon seen at Tbilisi’s Holy Trinity Cathedral to modify its visuals showing St. Matrona of Moscow, a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church, alongside Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, after a photograph of the icon sparked controversy on social media and led to its defacement. Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili on Tuesday slammed an alleged “coordinated campaign” by the “radical wing” of the domestic opposition against the Christian Orthodox Church of the country, which he claimed was aimed at “demeaning” the “symbols and values around which Georgians have rallied historically”.
